                            </div>
                            <p class="mb-35">Ex-share stands for experience sharing. This a program that brings together youths from diverse regions, to share their experiences and lessons
                            they have learned so that the coming generation can go through life in a smooth enjoyable way. We believe that there lessons unique to each one and their are
                            opportunities that we know of that could help others. 'My journey after high school was not an easy one. I had a dream of studying abroad but didn't have an idea where to 
                            start from. I went on to google and I got information on many opportunities which with time I came to learn that some were not legit. Goind through Zawadi Africa , opened my 
                            eyes to the importance of having someone who has walked the journey guide you. No they do not make the journey easier buy they do make it smooth and enjoyable. Applying alongside
                            other like minded people motivated me and pushed me to work on my application. Listening to alumni transformation journey made me realize how privileged I was. There were so many 
                            opportunities I could apply for but at the end of the day I could only take one. I wish my friends had information to the knowledge I had, to the opportunities and jobs around. May
                            be just that one opportunity would have changed their life.' That is what ex- share is about, sharing information on opportunities 
                            ( scholarships, and job) and giving you the mentoring thorough information sessions with previous beneficiaries and motivation to apply by grouping.</p>

In addition, we advise high school leavers on appropriate career choices through career expos and also engage on one-on-one mentorship programs throughout the year. As part of our CSR programs, we occasionally donate basic amenities like school uniforms, learning materials, sanitary towels and apprenticeships for needy students from various public schools.</p>

<p>
        We advise youths and other members of society on proper business management skills and coach them on various aspects in marketing, financial management, recruitment, production and supplies significant to business continuity. The beneficiaries are also trained on business presentation skills, proposals writing, communication and company profiling for effective tendering and procurement applications.
