    <h3>Educating youths on sexual habits</h3>
    <p class="mandala-text">Mandala is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. The circular designs symbolizes the idea that life is never ending and everything is connected.
      Mayans, Aztecs, Australian aborigines and European Catholics all created mandalas in one form or another, but mandalas are most common in Buddhist and Hindu art of the Indian subcontinent.
      Traditionally, a mandala is a geometric design or pattern that represents the cosmos or deities in various heavenly worlds.
      Mandalas, meaning "circles" in Sanskrit, are sacred symbols that are used for meditation, prayer, healing and art therapy for both adults and children. Mandalas have been shown in
      clinical studies to boost the immune system, reduce stress and pain, lower blood pressure, promote sleep and ease depression.</p>

    <h3>Effects of ignorant sexual habits</h3>
    <p class="painting-text">Painting is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition, gesture, narration, and abstraction.

      Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix" or "support").
      The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used.
      The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may
      incorporate multiple other materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole objects.</p>

    <p class="digital-art-text">
      Digital art is a general term for a range of artistic works and practices that use digital technology as an essential
      part of the creative and/or presentation process. Since the 1970s, various names have been used to describe the process
      including computer art and multimedia art, and digital art is
      itself placed under the larger umbrella term new media art. After some initial resistance, the impact of digital
      technology has transformed activities such as painting, drawing, sculpture and music/sound art, while new forms, such as net art,
      digital installation art, and virtual reality, have become recognized artistic practices. More generally the term digital artist is used to describe an artist who makes use of digital technologies in the production of art. In an expanded sense,
      "digital art" is a term applied to contemporary art that uses the methods of mass production or digital media.</p>
